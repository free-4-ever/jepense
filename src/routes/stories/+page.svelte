	I met a traveller from an antique land,<br />
	Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
	Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br />
	Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
	And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
	Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
	Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
	The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
	And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
	My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br />
	Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
	Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
	Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
	The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br />
	– Percy Bysshe Shelley
