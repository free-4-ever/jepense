			I met a traveller from an antique land,<br />
			Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
			Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br />
			Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
			And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
			Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
			Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
			The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
			And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
			My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br />
			Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
			Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
			Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
			The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br />
			– Percy Bysshe Shelley
